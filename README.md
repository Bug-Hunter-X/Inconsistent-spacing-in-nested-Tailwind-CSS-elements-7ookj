# Inconsistent Spacing in Nested Tailwind CSS Elements

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS concerning spacing inconsistencies when nesting elements.  Specifically, unexpected spacing or rendering problems might appear when using margin utilities like `ml-6` inside a parent element that already has padding applied.

## Bug Description

The bug showcases inconsistent spacing in a nested unordered list within a container element. List items may render with unexpected spacing due to a combination of padding and margin utilities, despite expected spacing being applied through `ml-6`.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run a development server (e.g., `npm run dev`) to view the application in a browser.
4. Observe the spacing inconsistencies in the list items.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates alternative approaches to achieve consistent spacing, ensuring proper rendering without unexpected gaps or overlaps between elements.  See the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected implementation.
